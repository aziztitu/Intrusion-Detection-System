# Intrusion Detection System (Demo)

**Intrusion Detection System** is a **security tool** which **captures all the packets on a given network adapter** and **looks for any intrusion** and reports to the user. The tool also **dumps the captured packets** to a separate file so it can be reviewed later if needed.

- I wrote this tool for a **College Project** in **2017** in **Java** using the **JNetPCap Library**. As of now, this tool **detects SSL Stripping** from well known IPs, but I plan to add more detection features in the future.
    - **Languages Used:** Java, CSS
    - **Platforms/Libraries:** JavaFX, JNetPCap Library, Git
